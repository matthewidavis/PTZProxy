# PTZOptics Cloud-Enabled Proxy

A FastAPI-based proxy server with a desktop GUI (Tkinter) and a web interface to remotely control PTZOptics cameras over LAN. This project routes API requests from cloud clients to LAN devices, handling PTZ control commands and camera snapshot requests while enabling remote access to the resources once properl set up.

## Overview

- **Proxy Server**: Uses FastAPI (with CORS enabled) to route requests from remote clients to LAN-based cameras.
- **Desktop GUI**: A Tkinter-based application that provides three main tabs:
  - **Proxy Control**: Start/stop the server, view logs, and enable ngrok tunneling.
  - **Site Management**: Manage whitelisted origins.
  - **Device Management**: Manage LAN device configurations.
- **Web Interface**: A browser-based control panel for live camera preview and PTZ control.

### Control Commands
- PTZ commands (e.g., pan, tilt, zoom, preset) are formatted to match the cameraâ€™s standard API.
- The URL construction uses URL encoding to embed the PTZ command parameters properly.

Example command URL:
```
/proxy/http?device=camera1&url=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fptzctrl.cgi%3Fptzcmd%26home
```

### CORS & Security
- CORS middleware is added so that remote web clients (from approved origins) can interact with the proxy server.

## Usage

- **Desktop Application**: Run the Python script (`ptzproxy.py`) to start the proxy server. Use the GUI to manage proxy settings, whitelists, and LAN devices.
- **Web Interface**: Open the `simplectl_cloud.html` file in your browser, set the proxy URL (ngrok or otherwise), and use the controls to interact with the camera.
